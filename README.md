This is a collection of powershell modules and scripts that I've made for various reasons. They should work fine, but who knows for sure. Feel free to submit a PR or feature request, and I'll take a look at it! 

|Script|Description|
|---|---|
|ConvertObjectTo-HTML.psm1|Converts a passed object into an HTML table, with support for custom styling.|
|DNSTools.psm1|A collection of functions for checking and setting the DNS servers of remote hosts.|
